you can use data for test in file db.json
Just copy it to the json-server directory
I don't know why, but it isn't sends to the git repository in json-server.


to run sercver use:
cd ./json-server
npx json-server --watch db.json - for first time
npm start - others time

server located on http://localhost:3000/


to run client app use:
cd ./client
npm i - for first time
npm start

client app located on http://localhost:3006/
